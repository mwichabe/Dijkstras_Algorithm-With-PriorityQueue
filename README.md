# Dijkstras_Algorithm-With-PriorityQueue
Implemented the Primâ€™s algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree.
Asked the user to make choice when executing your program: 1 for shortest path; 2 for minimum spanning tree.
Printed out the number of edges in the minimum spanning tree.
Visualize the shortest path and minimum spanning tree.
